## 🌱 Overview
The Enterprise Knowledge Assistant is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to help organizations interact intelligently with their internal documents.

This project integrates a modern full-stack workflow — React.js + Express.js + FastAPI + FAISS + Gemini API — to deliver fast document indexing, semantic search, and LLM-generated responses, wrapped in a clean, user-friendly interface for admins and staff.
